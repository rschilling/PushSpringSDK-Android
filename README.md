PushSpring Android SDK
=======================

The PushSpring SDK is designed to be incredibly easy to integrate with your app.  Once it's integrated, it will begin sending usage information to our servers, which you can then use to define user segments and send campaigns.

This SDK supports Android Gingerbread (2.3) and higher.  If you need support for an earlier Android version, contact us at hello@pushspring.com .

Full integration instructions can be found at http://www.pushspring.com/developer .
